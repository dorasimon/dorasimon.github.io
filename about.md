This is Kailin Xie's blog. I'm originally from Hunan, China (spicy girl Y^3^Y). I came to the US on the Christmas of 2012, studied at University of Houston for three years. After receiving my MBA, I came to San Francisco to look for a job, and fortunately, Ipsos, the third largest market research company in the world, offered me a job, so I worked as a market research analyst since April 2016 until February 2017. In April 2017, I joined Metis Data Science Bootcamp, with the anticipation of becoming a data scientist. I really appreciate the experience of working in the market industry and would love to continue after the bootcamp.

### More Information

I constantly ponder over life philosophy. After all these years, I realize that staying true to oneself is perhaps one of the most difficult things in life, but I still believe that it should be the ultimate goal of every individual, so I am striving my ass off to achieve it.
